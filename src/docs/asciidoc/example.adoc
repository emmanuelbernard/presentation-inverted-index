=== Nested bullets

* _Compose_ various projects as if there were one
** Each project can live in its own repository
** Each project has its own Gradle build
** Composition unites them through _dependency resolution_
* _Split_ monolithic projects
** For large multiproject builds, allows splitting them into several pieces
** Each piece can be versioned independently
** Developers can _choose_ what subprojects they care about
