== Agenda

* The Gradle Daemon
* Profiling
* Incremental builds
* Incremental compilation
* Continuous builds
* Composite builds
* Task output cache

== What is Gradle?

* A build tool
* Cloud Services

== The Gradle daemon

* Long-lived background process
* Listens and executes build actions
* Faster startup / execution
* Enabled by default since 3.0

== The Gradle daemon

=== Cold daemon

=== Warm daemon

image::daemon-keynote-warm.gif[]

== Profiling a build

`gradle --profile`

* Generates a report in the build directory
* Limited insight
* Not easily shareable
* But can already give precious information

== Build scans

[cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|
* First member of the Cloud Services family
* Insights into your build
* View and share via URL
* Debug, optimize and refine
* Analyze _all_ of your builds
* Available for free

== Build scan demo

https://scans.gradle.com/s/sample/groovy

== Creating a build scan

=== Apply the build scan plugin

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.gradle.build-scan' version '1.0'
}

buildScan {
    licenseAgreementUrl = 'https://gradle.com/terms-of-service'
    licenseAgree = 'yes'
}
----

=== Run the build

```
./gradlew -Dscan build
```

=== Click on the link

```
:jrubyPrepareGems
:asciidoctor UP-TO-DATE

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 1.132 secs

```

== Incremental builds

* Gradle is meant for incremental builds
* `clean` is a waste of time
* Prepare your builds for incrementalness

=== Example: building a shaded jar

[source,groovy]
----
task shadedJar(type: ShadedJar) {
   jarFile = file("$buildDir/libs/shaded.jar")
   classpath = configurations.runtime
   mapping = ['org.apache': 'shaded.org.apache']
}
----

* What are the task inputs?
* What are the task outputs?
* What if one of them changes?

=== Declaring inputs

[source,groovy]
----
@InputFiles
FileCollection getClasspath() { ... }

@Input
Map<String, String> getMapping() { ... }
----

=== Declaring outputs

[source,groovy]
----
@OutputFile
File getJarFile() { ... }
----

== Incremental compilation

* Given a set of source files
* Only compile the files which have changed...
* and their dependencies
* Language specific

=== Gradle has support for incremental compilation of Java

```
compileJava {
    //enable incremental compilation
    options.incremental = true
}
```

== Continuous builds

* Gradle watches for changes in task inputs
* Re-executes tasks as changes occur
* Enabled with `-t`

```
gradle -t asciidoctor
```

== Composite builds

* _Compose_ various projects as if there were one
** Each project can live in its own repository
** Each project has its own Gradle build
** Composition unites them through _dependency resolution_
* _Split_ monolithic projects
** For large multiproject builds, allows splitting them into several pieces
** Each piece can be versioned independently
** Developers can _choose_ what subprojects they care about

== Composite builds demo

== Task output cache

* Avoid doing work even after _clean_
* Share binaries between projects on a single machine
* Share binaries between projects on a network
* Backend agnostic

== Task output cache use cases

* Long compile tasks
* Bisecting
* Continuous integration
* Green earth

== Task output cache demo

With composite builds!
